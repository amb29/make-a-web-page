      <b>Introduction</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
     <p>
      There are at least five important subjetcs to be studied as basic elements on the web:<em> the web itself, the code language HTML, the repository URL, the protocol HTTP and proper web aplications</em>. First of all the web - or world wide web.

      <b>The World Wide Web</b>
    </div>
    <div class = "concept-description">
      <p>
        The <em>World Wide Web</em> is a collection of HTML documents, which stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. The documents are all linked to one another throught <em>Hyper Links</em>. All kinds of file can exist on the web, music, video, images - HTML documents can refer to anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are four main actors in the web: <em>users, computers + browsers, the internet itself and servers.</em> The user put up an internet adress on his browser and it makes a request via the internet to the servers, using the HTTP protocol. The servers respond with files displaced by the browser. Servers are computers which host files, and the HTTP is the main protocol used on internet communications. Web documents, as said before, are written in a language called HTML, the next topic.

      <b>HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        HTML or <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> is the language used to write documents placed on the web. It is made of four components: <em>text content</em>, or the text that can be seen; <em>Markup</em>, or what the text looks like; <em>References</em> to other documents; and <em>Links</em> to other pages. Text content is plain text, while markup is used to mark texts up. 
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept">
   <div class="concept-title">
    <b>HTML Markup</b>
   </div>
   <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        Texts are marked up using tags. Usually an <em>element</em> is made of an opening tab, a closing tab and contents, for example:
      </p>

      <p>
        Ex: &lt;name&gt;contents&lt;/name&gt; ----- This is called an <em> element</em>
      </p> 

      <p>
        In an element the contents inside the opening and closing tags are marked up with the effects of that tag. There are several kinds of tags, which one with its own markup effect on text, like the &lt;b&gt; bold tag, &lt;em&gt; emphasis - <em> italics</em> tag, Anchor tags &lt;a&gt;, used to make links, image tags &lt;img&gt;, among others. There are also tags with attributes &lt;tag attr = "value"&gt;, which have values. It is important to say that image tags are void tags, that don´t need a closing tab.
      </p>

      <b>Whitespace</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        All that is put in HTML turn in a single space. If a user writes a text in multiple lines, it appears in a single line, in whitespace. It is necessary to force multiple lines using tags. The <em>break tag &lt;br&gt;</em> is the first way. It is a void tag to be used after any line the users wants a break. The other way is with <em>paragrarh tag &lt;p&gt;</em>, which is not a void tag. The main difference between those two tags is that <em>&lt;br&gt;</em> is an <em>inline tag</em>, while <em>&lt;p&gt;</em> is a <em> block</em> one. 
      </p>

      <b>Inline and Block elements</b>
    </div>  
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        Block and inline tags have different behaviour. Inline elements fit within a line, somentimes ending it, like &lt;br&gt; tag. Block tags make and an invisible box around the text, that can have height and width. Examples of inline elements are: &lt;a&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;br&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;. Some examples of block elements:  &lt;div&gt;,&lt;p&gt;, &lt;form&gt;.

      <b>Container elements</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        Containers are elements that contain stuff inside them. There are two container tags: <em>&lt;span&gt;</em> and <em>&lt;div&gt;</em>. Span is an inline element, while div is a block one. They both can use CSS, which is a language to give styles to documents.

        It is good to remember that computers are stupid, and that is not a bad thing to say. They are stupid because they only interpret instructions literaly.

    <b>LESSON 2: CREATING A STRUCTURED DOCUMENT WITH HTML</b>
  </div>

    <div class="concept-title">
      <b>HTML, CSS and Javascript</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        <em>HTML files</em> are the structure of a webpage, <em>CSS files</em> are the style of a page, and <em>Javascript files</em> are the interactive components of a page. These languages define the rules for how webpages behave.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title">
      <b>HTML, Structure and CSS: tree-like structure</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p> 
        Webpages have branched structures like trees (<em>tree-like structure</em>). Branches are formed in coding, from big elements to small ones. The same structure may result in different looking webpages, depending on the style imprinted by CSS. It is important to remember that <em>HTML</em> and <em>CSS</em> are both <em>languages</em>. HTML controls the structure of a webpage, while CSS controls the style of a page.
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title">
      <b>HTML, CSS and the DOM</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">  
      <p>
        The DOM is the tree-like structure of a page. HTML is the language of the web. It has a specific syntax and rules. The basic word in the language of HTML is tag. The browser turns <em>tags</em> into elements, forming <em>trees</em>. It knows how to do it because of the <em>DOM</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>DOM</em> or <em>Document object module</em> is a form to represent and interact with elements in HTML. The <em>tree-like structure</em> observed in <em>developers tools</em> section of the browser shows a DOM tree that the browser builds from a HTML document. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        Each HTML tag creates an element in the DOM that browsers use to display the page. The content of a tag can be text, empty or even another tag. Every tag has a type or name that defines the element that will be created. Also tags can have attributes with values. With tags HTML documents define the structure and content of a page.
      </p>
      <p>
        To define the style of a page it is necessary to use another language: <em>CSS</em>. CSS allows the use of specific syntax and rules to change how elements look on the page (fonts size, color, background, orders, positions, etc.)
        <br>Ex: It is possible with CSS to state that all &lt;h1&gt; elements that belong to the class "article" must be dark blue.
      </p>
      <p>
        To tie structure and style together the HTML document can provide the browser with information on what style to use and where to get it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="concept-title">
      <b>Specific Rules of how elements work</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        Once the language is known, it is possible to look to the HTML code and get a good understanding of how the page organize and looks like, or, on the other way, how to break down a webpage into code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything in a HTML document is <em>retangular</em> - a <em>box</em>. There are other shapes in the world, like circles and triangles, that can be used in code with the help pf CSS styles. It is importante to focus that in a webpage everything is a box! Different shapes are made with style
      </p>
      <p>
        To use HTML one has to think in terms of boxes, asking: how do i draw a box in every element? How do i do it to reach simple elements, like an image or a text? 
      </p>
    </div>

      <b>Boxify a design</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        The design of the page must be put into boxes, to facilitate the HTML and CSS written work. Any method works to boxify: doodle in paper, print the page, or with ones imagination - the most efficient way must be chosen. A new design must be approached from big boxes to small boxes. Bigger boxes can be filled later with smaller ones.
      </p>
      <p> 
        The <em>&lt;div&gt;</em> tag can be used to define boxes in code. <br>
        ex: &lt;div&gt;my apps&lt;/div&gt;
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="concept">  
    <div class="concept-title">
      <b>Styles on boxes</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        To put style on boxes it is necessary to use CSS. For each element a <em>class attribute</em> must be given. A <em>class attribute</em> is like a label on a box, something made to remember its content. Boxes can have several labels, as tags, that can belong to multiple classes. It is good to have class names that make sense, that can be understood just by looking at the code.<br>
        ex: &lt;div class="tittle'"&gt;my apps&lt;/div&gt;

    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        Programming language can be written in any editor, but there are some specific tools for doing it, like sublime editor. When writing code, it is highly recommended the use of a programming text editor. It makes the life of a programmer easier.

    <b>LESSON 3: APPLYING STYLES TO HTML WITH CSS</b>

  <div class="concept">
    <div class="concept-title"> 
      <b>CSS</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        CSS stands for <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>. It is a computer language that tells html files what they should look like. It controls the style of a html document. Cascading means that the most specific rule is applied to every element. 
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS uses <em>selectors</em> to define particulars styles to be applied in each element.
      </p>
      <p>
        An important CSS concept is <em>inheritance</em>, which requires <em>abstract thinking</em>. This concept relies on ancestor-descendent relationship to operate, that can be seen on document trees of an html documents. By this mechanism properties are applied to a specific element and its descendents, just like in biology.

      <b>Avoidance of repetition</b>
    </div>
    <div class="concept-description">
      <p>
        In programming it is very important to avoid repetition. A repetition in code may lead to more work, since a little change in something means that all repeated code must be changed also. This may cause trouble and confusion. CSS helps programmers to avoid repetition. Using &lt;div&gt; or other elements it is possible to control all changes in the document appearence with the CSS code, making the job easier and faster.
